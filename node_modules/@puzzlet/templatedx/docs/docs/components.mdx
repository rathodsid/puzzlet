# Components

In TemplateDX, components function similarly to JSX, allowing you to pass props and children directly. To use a component, first import it, then insert it into your template. Specify any required props and content within the component tags. Inside the component, access props with `{props.varName}` and render any nested content with `{props.children}`.

For example:

**Index file:**
```jsx
import Blog from './blog.mdx';

# Example

<Blog title="Turtles">
  Turtles are really cool...
</Blog>
```

**Blog Component:**
```md Blog
# {props.title}

{props.children}
```
